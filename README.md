# writeon-mvp-sociallist
Frontend client app to dogfood content server API

A basic list creation and search application app, primarily created to test and drive the functionality and development of the LOOM API.

If Twitter = I am eating a donut,
Instagram = Here is a picture of my donut,
Foursquare = I am here eating a donut,

Then Sociallist = Here are my top 5 donuts in New York
